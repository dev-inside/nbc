# Nabu Casa Prototype

I'd created the screendesign for this prototype back in March 2024 as part of my application as UX-Expert. For my current application as Webdeveloper at the Nabu Casa team, I needed something to show, so I decided to code that page as a static prototype.

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.js
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.20. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
